### -> Backend: NodeJS -

***Step 1: Set up the NodeJS environment***

- First, initialize a new NodeJS project:

```bash
mkdir blockchain-marketplace
cd blockchain-marketplace
npm init -y
```

- Install necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install express body-parser crypto uuid
```

***Step 2: Create a simple blockchain***

- Create a file `blockchain.js`:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

class Block {
    constructor(index, timestamp, transactions, previousHash = '') {
        this.index = index;
        this.timestamp = timestamp;
        this.transactions = transactions;
        this.previousHash = previousHash;
        this.hash = this.calculateHash();
    }

    calculateHash() {
        return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(this.index + this.previousHash + this.timestamp + JSON.stringify(this.transactions)).digest('hex');
    }
}

class Blockchain {
    constructor() {
        this.chain = [this.createGenesisBlock()];
        this.pendingTransactions = [];
    }

    createGenesisBlock() {
        return new Block(0, '01/01/2020', 'Genesis Block', '0');
    }

    getLatestBlock() {
        return this.chain[this.chain.length - 1];
    }

    addBlock(newBlock) {
        newBlock.previousHash = this.getLatestBlock().hash;
        newBlock.hash = newBlock.calculateHash();
        this.chain.push(newBlock);
    }

    createTransaction(transaction) {
        this.pendingTransactions.push(transaction);
    }

    minePendingTransactions() {
        const block = new Block(this.chain.length, Date.now(), this.pendingTransactions, this.getLatestBlock().hash);
        block.hash = block.calculateHash();
        this.chain.push(block);

        this.pendingTransactions = [];
    }

    isChainValid() {
        for (let i = 1; i < this.chain.length; i++) {
            const currentBlock = this.chain[i];
            const previousBlock = this.chain[i - 1];

            if (currentBlock.hash !== currentBlock.calculateHash() || currentBlock.previousHash !== previousBlock.hash) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

module.exports = Blockchain;
```

***Step 3: Create a server to handle API requests***

- Create a file `server.js`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const Blockchain = require('./blockchain');

const app = express();
const blockchain = new Blockchain();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.get('/blocks', (req, res) => {
    res.json(blockchain.chain);
});

app.post('/transactions', (req, res) => {
    const transaction = req.body;
    blockchain.createTransaction(transaction);
    res.send('Transaction added');
});

app.get('/mine', (req, res) => {
    blockchain.minePendingTransactions();
    res.send('Mining complete');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

- Run your NodeJS server:

```bash
node server.js
```

### 2. Frontend: ReactJS

***Step 1: Set up the ReactJS environment***

- First, create a new ReactJS project:

```bash
npx create-react-app marketplace
cd marketplace
npm start
```

***Step 2: Create the marketplace interface***

- In the `src` directory, replace `App.js` with:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
    const [blocks, setBlocks] = useState([]);
    const [transaction, setTransaction] = useState({ from: '', to: '', amount: 0 });

    useEffect(() => {
        fetchBlocks();
    }, []);

    const fetchBlocks = async () => {
        const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/blocks');
        const data = await response.json();
        setBlocks(data);
    };

    const handleInputChange = (e) => {
        const { name, value } = e.target;
        setTransaction({ ...transaction, [name]: value });
    };

    const submitTransaction = async () => {
        await fetch('http://localhost:3000/transactions', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify(transaction),
        });
        fetchBlocks();
    };

    const mineBlock = async () => {
        await fetch('http://localhost:3000/mine');
        fetchBlocks();
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Blockchain Marketplace</h1>
            <div>
                <input type="text" name="from" placeholder="From" onChange={handleInputChange} />
                <input type="text" name="to" placeholder="To" onChange={handleInputChange} />
                <input type="number" name="amount" placeholder="Amount" onChange={handleInputChange} />
                <button onClick={submitTransaction}>Submit Transaction</button>
            </div>
            <button onClick={mineBlock}>Mine Block</button>
            <h2>Blocks</h2>
            <ul>
                {blocks.map(block => (
                    <li key={block.index}>
                        <p>Index: {block.index}</p>
                        <p>Timestamp: {block.timestamp}</p>
                        <p>Transactions: {JSON.stringify(block.transactions)}</p>
                        <p>Previous Hash: {block.previousHash}</p>
                        <p>Hash: {block.hash}</p>
                    </li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

### 3. Running the Example

- Start the NodeJS server:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

- Start the ReactJS application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Notes -

This example demonstrates a basic blockchain and a simple marketplace interface. In a real-world application, you would need to implement more complex features such as user authentication, a robust consensus mechanism, handling of NFTs, and ensuring compliance with regulations like KYC and GDPR. Additionally, security measures should be implemented to protect user data and transactions.

For a more advanced implementation, consider integrating a smart contract platform like Ethereum and utilizing libraries such as Web3.js for interacting with the blockchain.
