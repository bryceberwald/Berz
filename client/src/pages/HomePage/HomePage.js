        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I am 30 years old and on a continuous quest for knowledge in computer science utilizing my creativity by developing web applications, software, scripts and/or anything else that could be useful to myself and others. This website serves as a canvas where I can showcase my projects, share news and updates, and experiment with the latest technologies, especially using the power of ReactJS for personal gain.
